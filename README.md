# BER Estimator

This project demonstrates an implementation of a digital communication channel using the [PlutoSDR](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto) and the [IT++ (ITPP) library](http://itpp.sourceforge.net/). The system transmits digitally modulated signals over a channel, receives them through the PlutoSDR, and estimates the Bit Error Rate (BER) in real-world conditions.
